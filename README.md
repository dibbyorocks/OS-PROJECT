#Consider a scheduler which schedules the job by considering the arrival time of the
processes where arrival time if given as 0 is discarded or displayed as error. The scheduler
implements the shortest job first scheduling policy, but checks the queue of the processes after
the every process terminates and time taken for checking and arranging the process according
to the shortest job is 2 time unit. Compute the waiting time, turnaround time and average waiting
time and turnaround time of the processes. Also compute the total time taken by the processor
to compute all the jobs

P1	0	5
P2	1	3
P3	2	3
P4	4	1

Calculate the average turnaround time and average waiting time for each process. T
